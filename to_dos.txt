- folder -> dir
- fix musicxml to midi zero division errors
- update complexities, include key/tempo... changes
- when decoding tokens, set instruments to piano for both hands: 
    midi = tokenizer.decode(token_sequence)
    for instrument in midi.instruments:
        instrument.program = 0  # Program 0 = Acoustic Grand Piano
- include metadata in tokens, overwork metadata
- maybe make all conversion function init parameters arguments of music pipeline function in pipeline.py
- test model and adjust weights 
- test chord tokens
- organise imports to functions throughout
