- weights in metadata, include key/tempo... changes
- folder -> dir
- fix musicxml to midi zero division errors
- adapt metadata extraction to the two hands, update complexities
- when decoding tokens, set instruments to piano for both hands: 
    midi = tokenizer.decode(token_sequence)
    for instrument in midi.instruments:
        instrument.program = 0  # Program 0 = Acoustic Grand Piano
- make all conversion functions check file extension before conversion (or maybe centralistic via converter)
